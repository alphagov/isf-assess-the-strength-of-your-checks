      <p>
        How confident you need to be that someone is who they say they are depends on what your service does.
      </p>

      <p>
        You'll usually need to be more confident if your service gives users something valuable, like money or benefits. This is because your service is more likely to be targeted by users pretending to be someone they're not to get something they shouldn't.
