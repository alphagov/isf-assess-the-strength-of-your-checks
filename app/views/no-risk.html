        You might not need to do checks if the service:
      </p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet govuk-!-margin-bottom-6">
        <li>
          does not give access to any personal information about a user
        </li>
        <li>
          does not give something valuable to a user, such as money or benefits
        </li>
        <li>
          needs a user to physically go somewhere (such as a court or Post Office) to prove their identity
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If your service does not need to check a user’s identity but needs to let them access the service again to see or update their information, you can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/user-accounts">let the user create an account</a> instead.
      </p>

      <div class="govuk-inset-text">

          Example
        </h3>
        <p>
          The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) lets a user create an account for their <a href="https://www.gov.uk/jobsearch">Find a job</a> service. This is so the user can upload and update their CV and check on any job applications they’ve made.
        </p>
        <p>
          The service does not need to use GOV.UK Verify, because it does not give users anything valuable, or allow them to see any personal information they have not provided themselves.
        </p>
