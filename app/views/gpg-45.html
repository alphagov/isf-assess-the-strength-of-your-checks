      <p>You should read this guidance to help you decide how you or your service will check someone's identity.</p>

<p>You can use this guidance to work out which process you could use to check the identity of a customer, employee, or someone acting on behalf of a business. You could check someone’s identity:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>digitally</li>

<li>over the phone</li>

<li>by post</li>

<li>by email</li>

<li>face to face</li>
</ul>

<p>This guidance can also be used by people who:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>want to understand how another individual or organisation checks someone's identity (this includes auditing and certification of identity services)</li>

<li>are comparing different identity checking processes, for example comparing schemes with the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32014R0910&amp;from=EN">electronic identity and trust services (eIDAS) regulation</a> </li>
</ul>

<p>This guidance will not:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>tell you how to use accounts and passwords to give users access to something (also known as <a href="/government/publications/authentication-credentials-for-online-government-services">'authentication'</a>)</li>

<li>tell you how to assess your risk of identity fraud </li>

<li>be relevant if you ask users for information about their identity but do not check it (also known as 'self-assertion')</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="whatisidentity">What is identity</h2>

<p>An identity is a combination of characteristics that identifies a person.</p>

<p>A single characteristic is not usually enough to tell one person apart from another, but a combination of characteristics might be.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="whentocheckanidentity">When to check an identity</h3>

<p>You should check someone's identity if you or your service:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>show a user personal information about themselves, such as their driving licence or passport details</li>

<li>give the user something valuable, such as money or benefits</li>
</ul>

<p>Users will not need to prove their identity to access some services. For example, if your service just needs to recognise that someone has used it before, you can authenticate them (by asking for a username and password) without checking their identity.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="howtochecksomeonesidentity">How to check someone's identity</h2>

<p>You'll need to know the 'claimed identity' of the person you’re checking. A claimed identity is a combination of information (often someone's name, date of birth and address) that represents the characteristics of whoever a person is claiming to be.</p>

<p>When you have this, you can find out if the person is who they say they are. This process is known as ‘identity checking’ and is made up of 5 parts:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li><a href="#strength">get evidence of the claimed identity</a> (‘strength’)</li>

<li><a href="#validity">check the evidence is genuine or valid</a> (‘validity’)</li>

<li><a href="#activity">check the claimed identity has existed over time</a> (‘activity’)</li>

<li><a href="#identity-fraud">check if the claimed identity is at high risk of identity fraud</a> (‘identity fraud’)</li>

<li><a href="#verification">check that the identity belongs to the person who’s claiming it</a> (‘verification’)</li>
</ul>

<p>Doing different parts of the identity checking process will help you build up confidence in an identity so that you can be sure someone is who they say they are. </p>

<p>You do not have to do all parts of the identity checking process at once. You can do them over any period of time and gradually build up your confidence in an identity. </p>

<p>You'll get a score for each part of the identity checking process you do. The highest score you can get for each part is 4.</p>

<p>How much confidence you'll have in an identity depends on: </p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li><p>how many pieces of evidence you collect </p></li>

<li><p>which parts of the identity checking process you do</p></li>

<li><p>what scores you get for each part of the identity checking process</p>

<p>The different combinations of the identity checking process are known as 'identity profiles'. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Each identity profile relates to one of the following levels of confidence:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>low confidence (previously known as 'identity level 1')</li>

<li>medium confidence (previously known as 'identity level 2')</li>

<li>high confidence (previously known as 'identity level 3')</li>

<li>very high confidence (previously known as 'identity level 4')</li>
</ul>

<p>You should aim to get a higher level of confidence in someone's identity if you or your service are at high risk of identity-related crime.</p>

<p>How confident you are in a person’s identity can increase over time if you do extra checks or collect more evidence.</p>

<p>Your confidence can also decrease over time, for example if you later find out that a piece of evidence you used might have been lost or stolen at the time you checked that person's identity.</p>

<p>You can also reuse identity checks done by another organisation if they do some or all parts of the identity checking process explained in this guidance.</p>

<p>The identity checking process will help to prevent you from accepting an identity that's:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>'synthetic' (identities that have been made up) </li>

<li>‘stolen’ (when someone pretends to be someone else)</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="authoritativesources">Authoritative sources</h2>

<p>You might need to check things with an 'authoritative' source. To be authoritative for a particular piece of information, the source must make sure:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>the integrity of the information is protected</li>

<li>the information is up to date</li>
</ul>

<p>The source must also do one of the following:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>issue evidence, for example the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) issues evidence such as driving licences</li>

<li>get information from an organisation that issues evidence, for example credit reference agencies can have authoritative information about bank accounts </li>

<li>get information from another authoritative source, for example from another identity scheme</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="getevidenceoftheclaimedidentitystrength">Get evidence of the claimed identity ('strength')</h2>

<p>{:#strength}</p>

<p>This part of the identity checking process was previously known as 'Element A'.</p>

<p>Some pieces of evidence are 'stronger' than others, which means they will be harder to:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>forge (when an existing piece of evidence is changed to make it look like it belongs to someone else)</li>

<li>counterfeit (when a piece of evidence is created from scratch)</li>
</ul>

<p>How strong the evidence is depends on: </p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>what security features are on it (for example a hologram or an electronic chip)</li>

<li>what information it has</li>

<li>how the person proved their identity to get the evidence</li>
</ul>

<p>The stronger the evidence is, the higher its score will be. You must check and score one piece of evidence at a time.</p>

<p>To get evidence of a claimed identity, you can either:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>ask the person to provide evidence themselves, like a document (such as a passport) or account details (which they can show by giving you something like a bill or an account number)</li>

<li>find some evidence of their identity yourself, for example by checking existing databases</li>
</ul>

<p>The evidence can be physical or digital.</p>

<p>The identity is sometimes shown as a synonym on different pieces of evidence. For example, it might say the person’s name is Samantha on their passport, but Sam on their bank card. You can usually accept a synonym, unless you need to know the claimed identity's 'official' name (this is the name on any official documents they have, such as their passport).</p>

<p>The names might be different on different pieces of evidence. For example, someone's surname might have changed because they got married. If the names are different, you might need to collect other pieces of evidence or do other checks to make sure all the evidence belongs to the same person.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="score1">Score 1</h3>

<p>The evidence will have a score of 1 if it contains at least 2 of the following pieces of information:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>the claimed identity's name</li>

<li>the claimed identity's date of birth</li>

<li>the claimed identity's place of birth</li>

<li>the claimed identity's address</li>

<li>the claimed identity’s biometric information</li>

<li>a photo of the claimed identity</li>

<li>a reference number</li>
</ul>

<p>The evidence should come from an organisation that you know: </p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>checks the person's identity when they issue the evidence</li>

<li>makes sure its process for issuing the evidence will not be misused by people associated with the organisation</li>
</ul>

<p>Some examples of evidence that will have a score of 1 include an email, PDF or letter from a local authority.</p>

<p>You may not be able to thoroughly check the validity of evidence that has a score of 1.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="score2">Score 2</h3>

<p>The evidence will have a score of 2 if it has everything it needs to get a score of 1 and it includes information that's unique to either:</p>

<p>the identity
that piece of evidence</p>

<p>It must also:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>show the person's name instead of any pseudonyms, aliases or nicknames (if the evidence includes a name)</li>

<li>be protected by physical security features that stop it from being reproduced without specialist knowledge or information (if the evidence is a physical document)</li>

<li>be protected by cryptographic security features that can correctly identify the organisation that issued it (if the evidence includes digital information)</li>
</ul>

<p>Some examples of evidence that have a score of 2 include:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">

<p>This part of the identity checking process was previously known as 'Element B'.</p>

<p>To make sure you only accept a piece of evidence that's real you should check if it's:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">

<p>^ You will not need to do this part of the identity checking process to meet all the <a href="#identity-profiles">identity profiles</a>. ^</p>

<p>You should check if the claimed identity has interacted with other organisations. Some examples of interactions are:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>credit card transactions</li>

<li>student loan repayments</li>

<li>mortgage payments</li>

<li>gas or electricity account payments</li>

<li>when someone signs in to an online bank or retail account</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also check if the claimed identity has records that show it's been known by organisations over time. Some examples of these records are:</p>

<p>How confident you can be that the claimed identity was involved in an interaction depends on if:</p>

<li>the organisation the claimed identity interacted with checked their identity</li>

<li>the claimed identity's interactions are what you'd expect them to be</li>

<p>You should expect some people’s interactions to appear differently to others. What interactions you expect a claimed identity to have usually depends on the type of interaction they're doing and the type of person they are (like their age or financial situation).</p>

<p>If you can’t find interactions that happen in a way you’d expect for the claimed identity, you might be less sure that they were actually involved in the interactions. If this happens, you should find more interactions over a longer period of time.

<li>any equipment has been designed in a way that makes it difficult to be tampered with</li>

<li>someone who was trained in how to compare people to their identity evidence by a specialist trainer (such as the Home Office, National Document Fraud Unit or CPNI) supervises how the biometric information is captured</li>

<li>the supervisor refreshes their training every year</li>

<li>the supervisor monitors the behaviour of the person whose biometric information is being captured to make sure it's not suspicious</li>

<li>the area and equipment used to capture the biometric information has been designed in a way that reduces the likelihood of incorrect matches for the type of biometric information being used </li>
</ul>

<p class="govuk-inset-text">
<strong>Example</strong>
Some facial recognition software will be less accurate in different light conditions. A facial biometric comparison should take place under the best light conditions for the biometric algorithm that's being used. This will reduce incorrect matches and false rejections.</p>

<p>The area where the check is being done should also be monitored by trained personnel who make sure people are not trying to fool the system.

<!-- <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="identityprofiles">Identity profiles</h2>

<p>Each part of the identity checking process will protect you or your service against different identity risks.</p>

<p>There are a number of ways to combine parts of the identity checking process to meet a level of confidence in an identity. These combinations are known as identity profiles. </p>

<p>Each identity profile will give you one of the following levels of confidence:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>low confidence</li>

<li>medium confidence</li>

<li>high confidence</li>

<li>very high confidence</li>
</ul>

<p>You can only meet a level of confidence if you meet an identity profile. The higher the level of confidence an identity profile meets, the more protection you or your service will have.</p>

<p>An identity profile is made up of scores for each part of the identity checking process. To meet an identity profile, you must have all these required scores. You can use a score that's the same or higher than the score needed.</p>

<p class="govuk-inset-text">
<strong>Example</strong>
You need a validity score of 1 to meet an identity profile. The evidence from the person whose identity you're checking has a validity score of 2. You can use this score of 2 to meet the lower score requirements of the identity profile.
</p>

<p>You can choose to meet any identity profile. The identity profile you choose might depend on:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>how confident you need to be in someone's identity</li>

<li>what evidence your users are likely to have</li>

<li>which parts of the identity checking process you can do</li>

<li>how thoroughly you do each part of the identity checking process</li>

<li>how many pieces of evidence you need</li>
</ul>

<p>Meeting an identity profile and reaching a level of confidence will mean: </p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>you know how well your service is protected against identity risks</li>

<li>your identity checking process can be understood and reused by other organisations or services</li>
</ul>

<p>If you collect evidence from a user that does not include all the personal information you need, you will need to collect other evidence that does. You'll also need to link these pieces of evidence together to make sure they all relate to the claimed identity.</p>

<p class="govuk-inset-text">
<strong>Example</strong>
You need evidence of a person’s name and address. A person gives you a bus pass that shows their photo and address but not their name. They also give you a genuine passport that shows their photo and their name. You check these photos match, so you know both pieces of evidence relate to the same claimed identity.
</p>

<p>If you collect more than one piece of evidence, you must make sure the evidence has been issued by either:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>different organisations</li>

<li>an organisation that used a different identity checking process to issue each piece of evidence you're using</li>
</ul>

<p class="govuk-inset-text">
<strong>Example</strong>
You collect 3 pieces of evidence of a claimed identity from different organisations. One is a letter from a local authority, one is from a solicitor and one is from a gas company. They were all issued to the same claimed identity.
</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="lowconfidenceinthepersonsidentity">Low confidence in the person’s identity</h3>

<p>By meeting this identity profile, you will:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>have more than one piece of very strong evidence that shows the claimed identity exists</li>

<li>know the evidence is genuine and valid</li>

<li>have made sure you or your service have reduced the risks of any known identity fraud associated with the claimed identity</li>

<li>be confident the person's biometric information matches what's shown on the evidence</li>
</ul>

<p>This means the organisation that issued the evidence did multiple thorough checks to make sure the claimed identity exists in the real world (so you do not need to do an activity check).</p>

<p>By meeting this identity profile, you will:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>have very strong evidence that shows the claimed identity exists</li>

<li>have more than one other piece of strong evidence that shows the claimed identity exists</li>

<li>know the evidence is genuine and valid</li>

<li>have checked the claimed identity exists in the real world</li>

<li>have made sure you or your service have reduced the risks of any known identity fraud associated with the claimed identity</li>

<li>be confident the person's biometric information matches what's shown on the evidence</li>
</ul>

<p>You can do weaker activity and identity fraud checks because you have multiple pieces of evidence that were issued by organisations that checked the claimed identity exists in the real world.</p> -->
