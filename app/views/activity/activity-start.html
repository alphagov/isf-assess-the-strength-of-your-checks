      <p>
        Checking the identity has existed over time will lower the risk of you accepting either:
      </p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>a synthetic identity</li>
        <li>an identity that belongs to someone who's died</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        You can check this by looking for interactions the person has had with other organisations. Some examples of these interactions are:
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>credit card transactions</li>
          <li>student loan repayments</li>
          <li>mortgage payments</li>
          <li>gas or electricity account payments</li>
          <li>when someone signs in to an online bank or retail account</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        You can also check if any records exist that show if the person has been known by other organisations over time, such as their:
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>health records</li>
          <li>employment records</li>
          <li>school records</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>The highest score you can get for this check is 4.</p>
