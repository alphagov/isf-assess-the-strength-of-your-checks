    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>be able to be answered with information that's available in the public domain (for example in an open dataset or on a website that anyone can access)</li>
      <li>be able to be answered using information the person has submitted at another point in the identity checking process</li>
      <li>be predictable (the questions and answers should change each time someone goes through your identity checking process)</li>
