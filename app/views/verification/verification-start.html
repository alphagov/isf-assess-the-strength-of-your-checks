      <p>
        You might ask the person questions that only the person they’re claiming to be would know the answer to. The questions should be about things that you can also find the answer to, like the person’s financial activity.

          You could ask the person how much their monthly mortgage payments are. To be able to answer this, they'll need a mortgage (they would have had to prove their identity to get one) and have bills that were sent to their address.
