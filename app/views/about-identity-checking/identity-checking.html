          How identity checking works
        </h1>

        <p>Identity checking is made up of a combination of 5 pieces; evidence, validity, activity, fraud and verification.

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="strength">Evidence</h2>

        <p>Collect evidence from users. Some pieces of evidence are stronger than others and are harder to forge or fake.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="validity">Validity</h2>
        <p>Check the evidence is genuine or valid. This gives you protection against people using evidence that is lost, stolen, expired, revoked or synthetic.
        </p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="activity">Activity</h2>

        <p>Check the identity exists in the real world. This gives you protection against people who have created synthetic identities.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="fraud">Fraud</h2>

        <p>Understand if they are at high risk of fraud. This gives you protection against people using evidence that has been reported stolen, or impersonating someone who has died or is high profile.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="verification">Verification</h2>

        <p>Make sure the person is the same person as on their evidence. This gives you protection against people pretending to be someone else.</p>
