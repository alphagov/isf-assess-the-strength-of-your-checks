          How to be confident enough in an identity
        </h1>

        <p>Each part of the identity checking process will protect you or your service against different identity risks.</p>

        <p>There are a number of ways to combine parts of the identity checking process to meet a level of confidence in an identity. These combinations are known as identity profiles.</p>

        <p>Each identity profile will give you one of the following levels of confidence:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>low confidence</li>
          <li>medium confidence</li>
          <li>high confidence</li>
          <li>very high confidence</li>
        </ul>

        <p>You can only meet a level of confidence if you meet an identity profile. The higher the level of confidence an identity profile meets, the more protection you or your service will have.</p>

        <p>An identity profile is made up of scores for each part of the identity checking process. To meet an identity profile, you must have all these required scores. You can use a score that's the same or higher than the score needed.</p>

          How the prisoner service combined checks to protect against their level of risk
        </h2>
        <p>
          The prisoner service follows the identity standards to ensure that the right person has access to the right information.
        </p>
        <p>
          Following an identity risk assessment they chose a medium confidence profile. The prisoner service has a duty of care not to release information that could be harmful to the recipient.
        </p>
        <p>
          Choosing a medium confidence profile meant they needed to do some checks more thoroughly. The spicific profile they chose meant that by doing higher scoring (stronger) evidence checks they could do lower scoring checks for other parts.
